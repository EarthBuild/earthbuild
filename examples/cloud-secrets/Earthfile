PROJECT earthbuild-technologies/example
FROM alpine:latest

cloud-secrets:
  # This example assumes you have created a project using a command similar to:
  #   earthbuild projects --org earthbuild-technologies --project example
  # (where earthbuild-technologies has been replaced by your organization name)
  #
  # Next, a secret has been set by running:
  #   earthbuild secrets --org earthbuild-technologies --project example set token abc123
  #
  # You can verify it was set by running:
  #   earthbuild secrets --org earthbuild-technologies --project example ls
  # which should output:
  #   token

  # You can also view the secret by running:
  #   earthbuild secrets --org earthbuild-technologies --project example get token
  # which should output:
  #   abc123

  # secrets are referenced in an Earthfile by first defining the project name (using the
  # `PROJECT org/project-name` command); this is done right after the `VERSION` command.
  # Then the secret can be referenced via RUN:
  RUN --secret MY_SECRET=token test -n "$MY_SECRET"
  RUN --secret token test -n "$token"
  RUN --mount=type=secret,id=token,mode=0600,target=/root/secret-token ls -la /root/secret-token
