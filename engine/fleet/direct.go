// EnvDirectWait bounds how long a blob connection waits for a hole-punched path
// before transferring over a relay.
//
// **A relay is a detour and the transfer does not have to take it.** Two GitHub
// runners in the same datacentre fetched through a relay in us-west-1 and moved
// 7.9 MiB at about 1.2 MiB/s; the connection was up in milliseconds and the
// direct path arrives shortly afterwards, but the fetch had already started on
// whatever was validated first.
//
// Bounded, and short: where hole punching cannot land - which is the case
// relays exist for (E505) - this is pure delay, once per peer, and the build
// proceeds on the relay having spent it. Set to `0` to transfer on whatever is
// available.

// Three seconds against a transfer that is otherwise minutes. The trade is
// asymmetric by a wide margin in both directions: on a base of any size the
// relay costs far more than this, and where no direct path is possible the
// whole cost is three seconds per peer per build.
