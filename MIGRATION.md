# Migrating from `earthly` to EarthBuild

[`earthly`](https://github.com/earthly/earthly) was originally developed by [Earthly
Technologies](https://earthly.dev) as a corporately-sponsored open-source project.

In 2025, earthly [announced a pivot to a different business
model](https://web.archive.org/web/20250420142821/https://earthly.dev/blog/shutting-down-earthfiles-cloud/),
no longer maintaining `earthly` to focus on entirely different products and directions.

In response, the community has forked the project under the name `EarthBuild` to continue its development and maintenance.

## What to Expect from EarthBuild

<!--
  TODO: It would be good to add more details here about the project's governance,
  roadmap, and where to find community support (e.g., Slack, Discord, GitHub Discussions).
  This is critical information for any organization considering this migration.
-->

EarthBuild is a community-driven project. This means development is no longer backed by a single corporation but by a collective of users and contributors.

- **Stability**: The immediate goal of EarthBuild is to provide a secure, stable & reliable build tool for the community.
- **Open Governance**: The project aims for an open and transparent governance model.
- **Community Support**: Support is available through community channels.

## Key Changes

The most significant change is the removal of all features related to Earthly's commercial cloud offering.
EarthBuild focuses on being a great, self-hosted build tool.

Features related to the cloud-hosted earthly commercial offering were removed in the [final release of earthly
`v0.8.16`](https://github.com/earthly/earthly/releases/tag/v0.8.16) and will never be present in EarthBuild
releases.

We will maintain compatibility while logging warnings for other, more invasive, changes for releases of
EarthBuild on the `v0.8.x` minor version.

We will publish a breaking change to these features in the first unique minor version for EarthBuild, `v0.9.x`.

These changes include renaming of configuration variables from `EARTHLY_*` to `EARTHBUILD_*`, removal of Earthfile syntax related to cloud
hosting like `PROJECT` and naming of built-in arguments like `ARG EARTHLY_GIT_PROJECT_NAME` to `ARG EARTHBUILD_GIT_PROJECT_NAME`.

### Binary Name Change

The command-line tool has been renamed from `earthly` to `earth`. You will need to update your scripts, CI configurations, and any local aliases.

```diff
- earthly +all
+ earth +all
```

In the `earthlybuild/actions-setup` github action, we've aliased `earthly` to `earth`, logging the deprecated
usage, to ease the switch.

In version `v0.9.0` we will release a breaking change that removes the alias.

As of that version, you must update your CI configuration to use `earth` instead of `earthly` to reference the
CLI binary.

We recommend using this period of overlap to update your CI configuration in preparation of the release.

### Installation

To switch to EarthBuild, you will need to use the new installation scripts.

<!-- TODO: Add a link to the new installation instructions. -->
<!-- TODO: What do we want the new installer to do? Install aliases? Move config? -->

```bash
# Example of a potential new installation command
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://.../install.sh)"
```

- Mac - Brew
- Nix?
- WSL?

You should remove the old `earthly` binary from your systems to avoid confusion.

## Removed Features and Alternatives

The following commands and flags, mostly related to Earthly Cloud, have been removed.

### Removed Commands

| Command(s)                | Description                                    | Alternative / Migration Path                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| `satellite`, `satellites` | Managed remote runners (Buildkitd instances).  | You can run your own Buildkitd instances on any infrastructure and connect to them using `earth --buildkit-host <host>`. See [remote buildkit documentation](docs/ci-integration/remote-buildkit.md).                    |
| `cloud`, `clouds`         | Configured Cloud Installations for BYOC plans. | See `satellite` alternative.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `secret`, `secrets`       | Managed cloud secrets.                         | Use standard environment variables, `--secret` flags with local files (`--secret-file-path`), or integrate with your own secret management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) within your Earthfiles. |
| `web`                     | Opened the Earthly Cloud web UI.               | Not applicable.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| `gha`                     | Managed GitHub Actions integrations.           | The core GitHub Actions integration remains. See the CI section below. This command was for a specific, now-removed, part of that integration.                                                                           |
| `prune-auto-skip`         | Pruned auto-skip data.                         | The auto-skip feature has been removed, so this command is no longer needed.                                                                                                                                             |

### Removed & Changed CLI Options

- `--satellite`, `--sat`, `--no-satellite`, `--no-sat`: Removed. Use `--buildkit-host` (or configuration) explicitly to connect to a remote Buildkitd instance.
- `--auto-skip`, `--no-auto-skip`: The `auto-skip` feature, which depended on Earthly's cloud services, has
  been removed. If you are interested in this feature being restored in the community edition see <https://github.com/EarthBuild/earthbuild/issues/3>
- `--auth-token`: This flag has been removed since it was used for authenticating with Earthly Cloud. For registry authentication, use standard Docker authentication methods.
- The binary name in help texts and other places is now `earth` instead of `earthly`.

### Environment Variable Changes

All `EARTHLY_*` environment variables have been renamed to `EARTHBUILD_*` to reflect the project's new identity. The following environment variables are affected:

#### Removed Environment Variables

The following environment variables have been removed along with their associated features:

- `EARTHLY_TOKEN` - Used for Earthly Cloud authentication
- `EARTHLY_AUTO_SKIP` - Controlled auto-skip functionality
- `EARTHLY_NO_AUTO_SKIP` - Disabled auto-skip functionality
- `EARTHLY_SATELLITE` - Selected satellite for builds
- `EARTHLY_NO_SATELLITE` - Disabled satellite usage

#### Migration Strategy

**Immediate:** EarthBuild will continue to recognize `EARTHLY_*` environment variables in the current version but will log deprecation warnings encouraging migration to `EARTHBUILD_*` variables.

**Future Breaking Change:** In version `vX.X.X`, support for `EARTHLY_*` environment variables will be removed entirely. You must update your environment configurations before upgrading to that version.

**Standard Variables Unchanged:** Some environment variables remain unchanged as they follow standard
conventions:

- `DO_NOT_TRACK` - Standard analytics opt-out variable
- `GIT_USERNAME` - Git authentication username
- `GIT_PASSWORD` - Git authentication password
- `GITHUB_ACTIONS` - GitHub Actions environment detection

## Syntax

The core syntax of Earthfiles is largely unchanged.

Again, this will be logged as a warning in `v0.8.x` and removed, treated as an error, in `v0.9.x`.

The exception here is that the `PROJECT` command is removed entirely since it related to the cloud offering.

Built-in arguments are renamed from `ARG EARTHLY_*` to `ARG EARTHBUILD_*`.

## CI

### GitHub Actions

If you use the github actions CI integration (formerly
[`github.com/earthly/actions-setup`](github.com/earthly/actions-setup)), you should update your workflow yaml to
point to [`github.com/earthbuild/actions-setup`](github.com/earthbuild/actions-setup) instead.

```diff
   build:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v4
       - name: Setup Earthly
-         uses: earthly/actions-setup@main
+         uses: earthbuild/actions-setup@main
         with:
-          earthly-version: v0.8.5 # example
+          version: v0.9.0 # example, use the latest earthbuild version
       - name: Run build
-         run: earthly --ci +all
+         run: earth --ci +all
```
